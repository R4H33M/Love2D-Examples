# Love2D Examples

Some Love 2D examples. Severely needing of some polish, but good for learning some basic techniques and concepts.

The graphics and sound are mostly from [Kenney Assets](https://www.kenney.nl/).
I got the Minesweeper assets from [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/content/minesweeper-tile-set).

Current examples:
- "wamole": Whack a Mole clone
- "minesweeper": Minesweeper
- "pong": Two player Pong
- "space-invaders": Not really Space Invaders, more like Asteroids + Subway Surfers lol
- "random-color": Random colours; epilepsy warning!
